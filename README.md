# budgettool

A simple tool to keep track of expenses and earnings. Runs in a terminal on Windows or Linux.

This is a sandbox project I made to improve my problem solving skills with Python. The interface is supposed to be designed for people who don't use CLIs (e.g. my wife). This makes it easy-ish to use but does limit the functionality. A couple things may seem half-baked as I don't want to waste time "perfecting" something that only I will use. I decided not to write tests for the same reason.
