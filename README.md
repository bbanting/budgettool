# budgettool

A simple command line tool to keep track of expenses and earnings.

I can't see this being useful to anyone else but am now writing it as though it will be. The interface is supposed to be designed for people who don't use CLIs (e.g. my wife). This makes it easy-ish to use but does limit the functionality. 

## To Do

- [ ] Write tests
- [x] Export to csv
- [ ] Make new converter script

## Notes

- Make command params dependant on others
